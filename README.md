🚀 I’m excited to share my latest personal project – Character Counter App, a simple yet powerful frontend tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔗 Live Demo: (Add your GitHub Pages link here)

🎯 Project Highlights:

A clean and modern UI card layout styled with CSS (centered container, shadows, and rounded corners).

Message Box (textarea) where users can type messages with a character limit of 200 characters.

Real-time character counter that updates as the user types, showing the exact number of characters used out of the limit.

Character limit enforcement: prevents typing beyond 200 characters using substring().

Dynamic warning system:

Turns the counter red when close to the limit.

Displays a ⚠️ warning message once the user reaches the maximum limit.

Responsive design with neat typography for better readability.

💡 What I Learned:

Handling input events in JavaScript.

Using DOM manipulation to update counters and warnings in real time.

Implementing character limits with substring() and condition checks.

Styling modern UI components with CSS (box shadows, borders, and flexbox centering).

📌 Next Steps:

Add a customizable limit option so users can set their own maximum characters.

Improve UI with animations or progress bars to visualize remaining characters.

Make it mobile-first with responsive CSS tweaks.

Extend functionality to support word count along with character count.

This project gave me hands-on practice with JavaScript event handling, form restrictions, and live UI feedback, which are essential skills in modern frontend development.
